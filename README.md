## What is Tiny Melody Server?

Tiny Melody Server is a simple and efficient music server that allows you to play music files from your local device. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

## Why I write this?

The reason for having a “tiny-melody-server” is because I own a router with RK3568 and I need a lightweight music server that runs natively on OpenWrt without relying on Docker.

## WARNING

Tiny Melody Server is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing.
